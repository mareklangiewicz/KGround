# Feature Requirements

- DSL for creating correct github search queries.
- It's not really another CLI Kommand, but we will do it the same way
- Later it will be composed together with the `gh` Kommand
  - But this feature have to be useful on it's own, to generate and copy generated query into browser (github site)
    - Or to automatically copy it to clipboard using `xclip`.

- TODO first
  - read official github documentation pages about searching and write it all in .md files in this directory.
  - ask me numbered clarifying questions about the design of this feature
  - then rewrite this file to contains full requirements, useful to then generate the `plan.md`
